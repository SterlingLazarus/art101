					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to make a list where each number would be assigned a certain piece of text depending on what it is divisible by.</p>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This one took some time. The instructions weren't as straightforward this time so I had to do some trial and error to get everything to work. I struggled the most with getting the results to display properly in the HTML. </p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I'm curious what the practical uses of these projects are. I'm enjoying the process and we have been creating some cool websites, but I can't think of a use for this lab outside of the class. </p>
