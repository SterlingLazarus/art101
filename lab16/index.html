					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was the create a website that pulls data from the XKCD Comic API.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble getting this one to work. For some reason I kept getting this error: "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://xkcd.com/info.0.json' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." But, then I checked Wes' example site and he had the same error and his page wasn't displaying the project. Is that intentional?</p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I got very frustrated with this one. I never got it working. I spent a long time troubleshooting both with friends and with Chat GPT but nothing I did seemed to make a difference. I guess I'm just accepting defeat on this lab. I got every other lab working well, so I'm willing to accept defeat on this one. </p>
