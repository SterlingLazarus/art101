					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to debug past labs.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This one was very easy! I haven't had too much trouble getting labs to work, and when I did, I was able to push through and get them working before the project deadline. Because of that, I didn't have any projects to debug for this lab. </p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a nice lab to have this week. Since the team prototype is due this week, I have been busy with that. Being able to go back and reflect on past labs and fix them if necessary is a nice change of pace.</p>

				<h2>Debugging</h1>
				<img class="bigswat" srcset="./img/goldstar.jpg"> 
				<p>I got all my labs working properly so there is no need for debugging! I tried to answer some questions on stackoverflow.com but all the questions were above my pay grade.</p>
