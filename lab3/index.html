			<h1>Lab 3 -  File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to learn how to properly structure files so they aren't a mess when doing web design.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="special-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Honestly, I breezed through this one. Most of the lab was already set up for me so I just messed around with parameters to make it look a little bit different. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="special-section">
					<h2>Reflection and Results</h2>
					<p>Since a lot of the lab came baked into the repository we copied from Wes, I used this lab to mess around with HTML and CSS and try to learn some more functions. 
					   I now feel much more confident and caught up with the material we have learned so far. I have added custom images, custom fonts, and played around with the CSS 
					to make my website my own! </p>
