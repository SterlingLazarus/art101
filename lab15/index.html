					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was the create a website that pulls data from an API.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble getting this one to work. The code structure is more complicated than past labs since we are pulling from something external, but using Chat GPT and the code provided by Wes, I was able to get mine working.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a cool project. I managed to make mine a little more complicated by having it pull random data from the API and display it in a more aesthetically pleasing way than just a wall of text.</p>
