					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a text box to type your name in and then to click a button to randomize it.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This one was fairly straightforward. All the code was provided, but I did have some trouble implementing the text box where you put your name to be randomized. </p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was an interesting project. It feels like we are actually making progress. I have learned a lot in this class, and I've been enjoying it. I could build a basic website now and being able to add boxes to input data in is very useful </p>
