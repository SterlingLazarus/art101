					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a random text generator using jQuery.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This one was fairly straightforward. All the code was provided, I got lost at one part because the generateRandomText() function and the code for appending text to the #output div were outside the click event listener. Once I fixed that everything worked perfectly.  </p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was an interesting project. I must admit I have had a difficult time keeping up in this class and so I didn't fully understand what was happening in this lab. I did however, get it to work. I also messed around with the CSS a little bit.  </p>
